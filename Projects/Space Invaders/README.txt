This package contains the source code for the game 'Space Invaders'.
This game is written in z80 assembly for the ZX Spectrum.

The code has been successfully assembled and tested on both ZX Spin and Pasmo.
Using Pasmo allows you to produce a TAP file which can be read by most Spectrum
emulators or can even be used to produce a WAV file or tape copy of the game.

There is a TAP file included in the package that can be used on an emulator.

This game was developed completely within the TommyGun development tool.
A TommyGun project file is included in the source code. So you can easily 
modify the source code and graphics.

Space Invaders was designed and programmed by Toshihiro Nishikado for Taito, 
Japan in 1978 and remains one of the most popular arcade games ever made.

Please note that I do not hold the copyright for Space Invaders.
My copyright is only on the source code and associated project files used
to clone this great game.
