  Better support for modern OS's (Windows 8+)
  Future versions will all be ZX Spectrum ONLY!
  NO MORE MULTI-MACHINE SUPPORT

  o Installer will only overwrite the example projects if the new files are newer
    If you make changes to the examples files you could lose those changes
    Clone the project and make changes to that copy

    Scintilla has a much more Visual Studio feel to it
    Scintilla DLL is also smaller than SynEdit (1646Kb to 432kb)

  o Enter key works in the project list to load a project
* AGD Game Editor
  o Removed AGD Arcade Games Designer 
    There is a dedicated AGD editor in development
* Code Editor
  o Changed the Build system to use a "Tools" system
    Each tool has to be defined
    Each project specifies the tools it uses
    If a tool is not setup; then it is added and the user needs to define the location of the tool
    A tool is any application that is used outside of TommyGun
        e.g. Pasmo to compile assembly, Z88DK ZCC to compile C code, ZX Spin to run the project output
    You define whether a tool is a Builder or an Emulator
        Builders are used to compile the code
        Emulators are used to run the code
    The new Tools system will convert the old settings over the new system
    Once you have setup your tools; you shouldn't have to change them
  o Fixed a really annoying bug with the Build button where it would build every ASM file and not just the one in the emulator parameters
    You can supply any number of file names or use a wildcard (*.asm, *.c etc)
    And now not needed because I rewrote the build system
  o Removed the Build Selected and Stop buttons (I never use them, not sure they even work)
  o Added an Editor Options toolbar button. I wonder how long that has been missing?
  o Play button now does it all; Saves, Updates Resources, Builds and Runs the game (simples)
  o Fixed load compiler/emulator settings issue
  o Fixed issue where double clicking to goto an error line open a non existent file. If there was not a valid file on the line.
  o Fixed issue with Parameter substitution.
    Can now use %game% to get the game project name.
    For example: %game%.tap %game%.map to produce "My Game.tap" and "My Game.map" from pasmo.
  o Added bigger switch buttons to the Editor/Build Options dialogs
  o Fixed some keyboard handling issues
  o Fixed an issue where the application would crash while opening another project when files were opened in the code editor
  o Removed %infile% build variable
  o Updated %PFolder% and %game% build variables to work better
