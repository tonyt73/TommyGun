    Each tool has t* be defined
    Each project specifies the tools it uses
    If a tool is not setup; then it is added and the user needs t* define the location of the tool
    A tool is any application that is used outside of TommyGun
        e.g. Pasm* t* compile assembly, Z88DK ZCC t* compile C code, ZX Spin t* run the project output
    You define whether a tool is a Builder or an Emulator
        Builders are used t* compile the code
        Emulators are used t* run the code
    The new Tools system will convert the old settings over the new system
    Once you have setup your tools; you shouldn't have t* change them
  * Fixed a really annoying bug with the Build button where it would build every ASM file and not just the one in the emulator parameters
    You can supply any number of file names or use a wildcard (*.asm, *.c etc)
    And now not needed because I rewrote the build system
  * Removed the Build Selected and Stop buttons (I never use them, not sure they even work)
  * Added an Editor Options toolbar button. I wonder how long that has been missing?
  * Play button now does it all; Saves, Updates Resources, Builds and Runs the game (simples)
  * Fixed load compiler/emulator settings issue

  * Fixed issue with Parameter substitution.
    Can now use %game% t* get the game project name.
